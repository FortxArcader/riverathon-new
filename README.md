**Riverathon 1.0** is a national-level hackathon organized by Amity School of Engineering & Technology, Noida, in collaboration with the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the Namami Gange Programme. It is India’s first hackathon focused on river systems using LiDAR data from the Survey of India.

The event unites students, researchers, and professionals to create tech-driven solutions for sustainable river restoration. Challenge areas include floodplain mapping, sediment and biodiversity management, disaster response, and digital twin modeling—aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The hackathon has five stages: Ideation, Screening, Mentorship, Development, and Grand Finale. Projects will be judged on innovation, technical depth, environmental impact, and clarity.

Prizes worth ₹3.5 lakhs and mentorship opportunities are up for grabs. The event is supported by experts from NMCG, ISRO, IITs, and Amity University.
